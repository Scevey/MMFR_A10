Bounding Object Manager HW Assignment.
----------------------------------------------
Team: Mighty Morphing Flower Arrangers
----------------------------------------------
Workload:
Giallella, Anthony: Implemented all BO functions for a circular BO which was duplicated and edited for the cubes BO and used with the BOM
John, Justin: Fixed the cube bounding box, finished the Bounding Object Manager, implemented it in AppClass and cleaned up bugs. Additionally, provided moral support and comic relief.
Lampanaro, Paul: Created Bounding Object Manager and implemented 75% of functionality.
Lauren-Alexandra Stapleford: Added starting code for Bounding Cubes, added .gitignore
Teixeira, Mike: Changed appclass to use cube BO, set up Box to Sphere collisions for EC
----------------------------------------------
Extra Credit: We set up calculations that will allow for boxes and spheres to be checked properly for collisions with each other.
